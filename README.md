[![My homepage](public/pics/wpww_splash.svg)](http://wpww.pl)

This is the code of my homepage, which I use as a CV. As any CV does, it sums up my experiences and achievements as a technician💻 and musician🎸, with a little blend of miscellaneous facts🍿.

Made with **React**, motivated by... I don't know, vanity, narcissism? 🎈 That's weird to say...

- 🎨 custom vector icons
- 🌐 i18n
